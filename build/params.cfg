### DATA PREPROCESSING

### ALIGNMENT (forwarded to segemehl.x)

accuracy = 90 # min percentage of matches per read in semi-global alignment

exclclipping = 0 # exclude soft clipping from
unprd = 0 # only for paired-end reads: include unpaired reads in the subsequent analysis

### SPLIT READ CALLING 
sitelenratio = 0.0
cmplmin = 0.0 # complementarity cutoff - consider only split reads that exceed cmplmin
nrgmax = 0 # hybridization energy cutoff - consider only split reads that fall beneath nrgmax

### CLUSTERING
clust = 1 # clustering of the split reads can either be omitted (=0) or included (=1)
clustdist = 0 # minimum distance between clusters

### ANALYIS
# specify the annotations of the organism of interest (optional)
features = /Users/riasc/Documents/work/projects/RNAnue/build/ecoli_BL21_DE3.gff # GFF3 feature file

# OUTPUT
stats = 1 # produce a statistics of the libraries
outcnt = 1 # (additionally) produce a count table as output
outjgf = 1 # (additionally) produce a JSON graph file for visualization
